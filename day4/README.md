# Mental Health of Remote Workers - Analysis & Classification

This project explores the mental health status of remote workers using the dataset from Kaggle:  
ðŸ”— [Mental Health of Remote Workers Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishekjaiswal4896/mental-health-of-remote-workers/data)

## Overview

Applied classification models to predict the **Mental Health Status** (Poor, Moderate, Good) of employees working remotely, based on features like:
- Work hours, exercise, sleep
- Communication effectiveness
- Access to therapists, burnout score, etc.

## Models Used

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting  
- K-Nearest Neighbors  
- SVC  
- XGBoost

The best performing model was **XGBoost**, achieving around **50% accuracy**.

## Requirements

- Python  
- pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost, matplotlib

## File Descriptions

- `Mental Health Analysis.ipynb`: Main notebook with preprocessing, model training & evaluation  
- `mental_health_remote_workers.csv`: Cleaned dataset used for training
