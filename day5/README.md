# Mercedes Car Prices Data Analysis Project

This project contains basic data analysis, visualization, and machine learning (with TensorFlow) using the `merc.xlsx` dataset. All code and analyses are provided in Python within a Jupyter Notebook.

## Contents

* Data loading and preprocessing
* Basic statistical analyses
* Annual and categorical distributions
* Regression analyses and plots
* **Deep Learning regression models with TensorFlow/Keras**

  * Model training, prediction, and evaluation
  * Visualization of model results

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries:

   ```
   pip install pandas matplotlib openpyxl tensorflow scikit-learn
   ```
2. Open the `merc.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run all the cells in order.

## Machine Learning / Deep Learning

* The notebook includes TensorFlow-based neural network models for regression analysis.
* You can see:

  * Model architecture and summary
  * Training and validation loss curves
  * Model prediction scores (MAE,MSE)

## Data Source

* The analysis is based on data from the `merc.xlsx` file.

## Note

* The analysis results are for demonstration purposes only. You can repeat the analysis with your own data.
